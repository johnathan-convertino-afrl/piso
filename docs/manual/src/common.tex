\section{Usage}

\subsection{Introduction}

\par
This core converts the parallel data into serial data. This is done on a positive clock edge in relation to a active high enable.
The enable sets the rate and should only be held high for the same period as the main clock. This core is useful for any parallel to
serial operation such as UARTS, SPI, i2c, 1553, etc. This is a fusesoc 2.X compatable core and its VLNV is AFRL:simple:piso:X.X.X.
\subsection{Dependencies}

\par
The following are the dependencies of the cores.

\begin{itemize}
  \item fusesoc 2.X
  \item iverilog (simulation)
  \item cocotb (simulation)
\end{itemize}

\input{src/fusesoc/depend_fusesoc_info.tex}

\subsection{In a Project}
\par
This core is meant to be used on the same clock domain as the input parallel data. The serial output rate is set by the enable.
The enable should only be pulsed for one clock cycle. If the clock is the rate the enable should be tied high. Load has to be
used to set the input data and reset the output count. The data count allows other cores to know what bit currently being
output from the core. On load no data is output till the enable is pulsed and is kept at the output till load is set. Load
will zero the output, also can be zeroed by just continuing to use enable past the full bit count (internal reg is filled with zeros).
The series of steps to use the core are as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Set pdata to input data, and set load to 1 (data will be loaded on positive clock edge to internal registers).
  \item Set load to 0 (dcount will now be the max number of bits in the word loaded).
  \item Pulse enable to 1 that is synced to the main clock. Only hold high for one period of the master clock.
  \item Repeat enable pulse until dcount is equal to 0.
\end{enumerate}

Adding the core to a fusesoc project, outside of adding the verilog module to your code, requires it is added as dependency.
Example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  dep:
    depend:
      - ">=AFRL:simple:piso:1.0.0"
\end{lstlisting}

Module instantion:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Verilog]
    piso #(
      .BUS_WIDTH(4)
    ) inst_piso (
      .clk(clk),
      .rstn(rstn),
      .ena(ena),
      .load(load),
      .pdata(pdata),
      .sdata(sdata),
      .dcount(dcount)
    );
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Architecture}
\par
This core is made to interface parallel to serial data. Data is loaded into the core, and then enable is pulsed to
push data out in a serial fashion. There is a count output that tells how many bits have been output. Data is only output
when the enable is toggled. The counter will start at the max number of bits. For a 32 bit word this will be the decimal 32.
When toggled the counter will state the number of the bit present at the output. Starting at 32 means once enable is active,
and the counter is 31, bit 31 of the loaded word will now be output on the serial output. When the counter reaches 0 it means
the internal register has output all data since the last bit, 0, is now present on the serial output. Any further enable
pulses will not change the count but will shift the internal register. This will result in a 0 at the output since the register
shifts in 0 bits as each bit is output. All data is shifted in MSb to LSb. Meaning Bit 31 is output first and 0 is last.
The only module is the piso module. It is listed below.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{piso} Convert parallel data to serial data. (see core for documentation).
\end{itemize}

Please see \ref{Module Documentation} for more information.

\subsection{Waveform}
Below is a waveform in a typical application of the core. This shows the count down and how the enable is pulsed to increment it.

\section{Building}

\par
The PISO core is written in Verilog 2001. They should synthesize in any modern FPGA software. The core comes as a fusesoc packaged core and can be
included in any other core. Be sure to make sure you have meet the dependencies listed in the previous section.

\subsection{fusesoc}
\par
Fusesoc is a system for building FPGA software without relying on the internal project management of the tool. Avoiding vendor lock in to Vivado or Quartus.
These cores, when included in a project, can be easily integrated and targets created based upon the end developer needs. The core by itself is not a part of
a system and should be integrated into a fusesoc based system. Simulations are setup to use fusesoc and are a part of its targets.

\section{Simulation}
\par
There are a few different simulations that can be run for this core.

\subsection{iverilog}
\par
iverilog is used for simple test benches for quick verification, visually, of the core. This will autofinish after it has
run up to a certain number of words have been output.

\subsection{cocotb}
\par
This method allows for quick writing of test benches that acutally assert and check the state of the core.
These tests are much more conclusive since it will run all test vectors and generate a report if they
pass or fail. All tests generate to a single fst wave file. The method of launching the tests is to use
fusesoc. These have not been written to use the python runner method or makefiles.
To use the cocotb tests you must install the following python libraries.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ pip install cocotb
\end{lstlisting}

The targets available are listed below.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{sim\_cocotb} Standard simulation PISO conversion using cocotb.
\end{itemize}

Then you must use the cocotb sim target. The targets above can be run with various parameters.
This test will check the input/output against each other to validate core operation.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ fusesoc run --target sim_cocotb AFRL:simple:piso:1.0.0
\end{lstlisting}
